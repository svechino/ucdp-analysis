"""Creates a JSON file that can be used by precalculated_text_measurer.py.

Creates a JSON file that can be used by
precalculated_test_measurer.PrecalculatedTextMeasurer to calculate the pixel
length of text strings rendered in DejaVu Sans font.

The output JSON object is formatted like:
{
    'mean-character-length': <float: the average pixel length of a character in
                              DejaVu Sans at 110pt>,
    'character-lengths': <Map[str, float]: a mapping between single characters
                          and their length in DejaVu Sans at 110pt>,
    'kerning-characters': <str: a string containing all of the characters that
                           kerning information is available for>,
    'kerning-pairs': <Map[str, float]: a mapping between pairs of characters
                      (e.g. "IJ") to the amount of kerning distance between
                      them. Positive values are *subtracted* from the string
                      length e.g. text-length-of("IJ") =>
                            (character-lengths["I"] + character-lengths["J"]
                            - kerning-pairs["IJ"])
                      If two characters both appear in 'kerning-characters' but
                      don't have an entry in 'kerning-pairs' then the kerning
                      distance between them is zero.
